<div id="item7"><a href="https://mamky.github.io/Projects.html">Projects</a></div>
<div id="item9"><p>These projects and practices helped me learn how to use markdown, CSS and HTML to create intresting websites which have spiked my curiousity of computer science and web design. I hope to major in this or something similar in college.</p>

<p>It took quite a while to do all of these projects and it was pretty hard but it was still fun due to the fun activities we did at the start like this one online game that teached us commands like ls and cd and this other game in person where we sent "data packets" which were represented by paper to each other.</p>
