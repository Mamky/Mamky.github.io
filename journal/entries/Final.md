# Developer's Journal: 3D Blackjack Game Breakdown

This document outlines the architecture and functionality of the single-file 3D Blackjack game. The goal of this project was to create an immersive, visually appealing Blackjack experience using only standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) without external libraries or frameworks.

## 1. Game Overview: The Rules of Blackjack

Before diving into the code, it's important to understand the game it implements. Blackjack is a card game where the player competes against the dealer.

*   **Objective:** Get a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer, without exceeding 21.
*   **Card Values:**
    *   Numbered cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
    *   Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10.
    *   An Ace is worth either 1 or 11, whichever is more advantageous for the hand.
*   **Gameplay Flow:**
    1.  **Betting:** The player places a bet.
    2.  **Dealing:** The player and dealer each receive two cards. The player's cards are face-up; the dealer has one card face-up and one face-down.
    3.  **Player's Turn:** The player can "Hit" (take another card) or "Stand" (end their turn). If the player's score exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose immediately.
    4.  **Dealer's Turn:** The dealer reveals their hidden card. They must hit until their score is 17 or higher.
    5.  **Resolution:**
        *   If the dealer busts, the player wins.
        *   If neither busts, the higher score wins.
        *   A tie is a "push," and the player's bet is returned.
        *   A "Blackjack" (an Ace and a 10-value card on the initial deal) is an automatic win with a higher payout (typically 3:2).

## 2. Code Architecture Breakdown

The entire game is contained within a single HTML file, which is organized into three distinct parts: HTML for structure, CSS for presentation, and JavaScript for logic.

### 2.1. The HTML Structure (The Stage)

The HTML defines the elements of our game world. It's built like a theater stage.

*   `#game-container`: The main viewport for the 3D scene. The `perspective` property is applied here, which is crucial for creating the 3D effect.
*   `#table`: Sits inside the container and holds all the table elements. It's rotated to give the player a top-down, angled view. `transform-style: preserve-3d` is set here so that its children can be positioned in 3D space.
*   `.table-surface`: The green felt area where the action happens. It contains:
    *   `#opponent-model`: A simple, charming "dealer" model built from styled `div`s (`.head`, `.torso`, etc.).
    *   `#player-hand` & `#opponent-hand`: Empty containers where the card elements will be dynamically added by JavaScript.
    *   `#betting-circle` & `#chip-stack`: Visual areas for the betting interface.
*   `#ui-container`: A 2D layer at the bottom of the screen (`position: fixed`) that holds all the controls (`.btn`) and the status message bar. It is not part of the 3D scene.
*   `#overlay`: A full-screen element used to display game-start and end-of-round messages, temporarily pausing the game.

### 2.2. The CSS Styling (The 3D Illusion & Atmosphere)

The CSS is responsible for the game's entire look and feel, most importantly the 3D effect.

*   **Creating the 3D Scene:**
    *   `perspective: 900px;` on `#game-container` tells the browser how "deep" the 3D world is. Lower values mean more extreme perspective.
    *   `transform-style: preserve-3d;` on `#table` allows its children to be positioned along the Z-axis (depth).
    *   `transform: rotateX(65deg);` on `#table` is the key transform that tilts the entire table towards the viewer, creating the angled 3D view.

*   **Card Animation:**
    *   Cards have a front and a back face. `backface-visibility: hidden;` ensures you only see one side at a time.
    *   A card starts with `transform: rotateY(0deg)` (back facing you).
    *   The `.flipped` class applies `transform: rotateY(180deg);` to reveal the front. The `transition` property on the `.card` class animates this rotation smoothly.
    *   Cards are dealt to the correct position using `transform: translateX(...)`. The offset is calculated in JavaScript based on how many cards are already in the hand.

*   **Betting Chips:**
    *   Chips are stacked using 3D transforms. Each new chip added to the `#chip-stack` is given a `transform: translateZ(...)` style with an increasing value, making it appear stacked on top of the previous one.

### 2.3. The JavaScript Logic (The Brains)

The JavaScript orchestrates the entire game. It's structured around a central `state` object and a clear sequence of functions.

#### a. State Management

A single `state` object at the top tracks everything that changes during the game:

```javascript
let state = {
    turn: 'betting',      // Whose turn it is: 'betting', 'player', 'opponent', 'end'
    playerMoney: 100,     // The player's current wallet
    currentBet: 0,        // The bet for the current round
    deck: [],             // The current shuffled deck of cards
    playerHand: [],       // The player's cards
    opponentHand: []      // The dealer's cards
};
```
This approach makes it easy to see the game's current status at a glance and simplifies debugging.

#### b. The Game Loop

The game operates in a clear cycle, managed by a series of functions.

1.  **`initGame()`**: Called at the very beginning. It resets the `state` object to its default values (e.g., player money to $100) and calls `startBettingPhase()`.

2.  **`startBettingPhase()`**:
    *   Resets the hands, bet, and UI elements for a new round.
    *   Sets `state.turn = 'betting'`.
    *   The `updateUI()` function shows the betting controls and hides the game controls.
    *   The game now waits for player input via the betting buttons.

3.  **`startRound()`**:
    *   Triggered when the player clicks "Deal".
    *   It creates and shuffles a new deck.
    *   It uses `async/await` and a `delay` function to deal cards one by one (`dealCard()`) in the correct sequence (Player, Dealer, Player, Dealer).
    *   It checks if the player got a Blackjack (21 on the first two cards). If so, it ends the round immediately. Otherwise, it sets `state.turn = 'player'`.

4.  **Player's Turn (Event-Driven)**:
    *   When `state.turn === 'player'`, the "Hit" and "Stand" buttons are enabled.
    *   **Hit**: The player gets another card (`dealCard('player', true)`). The script checks if the new score is over 21. If so, the player busts, and the round ends (`endRound('opponent')`).
    *   **Stand**: The player's turn is over. The game transitions to the dealer by calling `setTurn('opponent')`.

5.  **`runOpponentAI()`**:
    *   This function contains the dealer's logic. It's called automatically when `state.turn` becomes `'opponent'`.
    *   It first flips the dealer's face-down card.
    *   It then enters a `while` loop, hitting (taking a new card) as long as its score is less than 17.
    *   Once the score is 17 or more, it stands.
    *   Finally, it calls `evaluateWinner()` to compare scores.

6.  **`endRound()`**:
    *   This function handles the outcome. It calculates winnings or losses based on the result (`'player'`, `'opponent'`, `'push'`, `'blackjack'`).
    *   It updates `state.playerMoney`.
    *   It calls `showOverlay()` to display a message with the result and a "Next Round" button. Clicking this button starts the cycle over again at `startBettingPhase()`.

#### c. Key Helper Functions

*   `calculateScore(hand)`: A pure function that takes an array of cards and returns the score, correctly handling the dual value of Aces.
*   `dealCard(target, isFaceUp)`: Deals one card from the deck to the specified `target` ('player' or 'opponent') and decides whether it should be face-up. It calls `renderCard()` to create the visual element.
*   `renderCard(...)`: Dynamically creates the HTML for a new card and adds it to the DOM with a dealing animation.
*   `updateUI()`: A crucial function that syncs the entire visual interface (money display, bet display, button states) with the data in the `state` object. It's called whenever the state changes.

THIS IS ALL AI!! On brand for the project.
