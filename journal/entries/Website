# Wordpress

[My Wordpress website](mamkycom.wordpress.com)

I looked at the aps site and some game sites like classroom 6x and I took their image presentations and even added a map to make it look like game websites. I also kept things symmetrical and similar in style like classroom 6x and my favorite site mangadex. I think I did ok but couldv'e improved if I locked in.

I had some troubles at first with wordpress like how to add text and images and save. I looked around and saw the plus which I pressed and saw all the things you could do and was even more confused. I figured it out and it helped my quite a bit since it saves quickly without a blunder and is easy to get accustomed to. I rate it a 8/10 for newbies but I would stick to terminal and git since it feels more cozy to me.
