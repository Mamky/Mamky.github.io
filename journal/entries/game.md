# Game Development Journal

## Genre
This game will be a **carnival-style shooting gallery** where the player controls a gun with their mouse, aiming at moving targets.

## Objectives
- Players must shoot as many targets as possible within a time limit.
- Each successful hit increases the **score**.
- Some targets will be worth more points based on difficulty.
- **Winning Condition:** Achieve a high score before time runs out.
- **Losing Condition:** If time expires with a low score, the game ends.

## Player Interaction
- The player **controls the gun using the mouse**, aiming and clicking to fire.
- Targets move in different patterns, requiring precision and timing.
- Some special targets may have unique effects, like extra time or score multipliers.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
For the initial prototype, I'll focus on:
- **Mouse-controlled aiming and shooting**.
- **Basic moving targets** with varying speeds.
- **Score tracking and display**.
